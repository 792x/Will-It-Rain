# Will-It-Rain (NL only)
Simple responsive website made with Bootstrap using the Google maps and Buienradar APIs to keep you dry.

As it is quite awkward to bring an umbrella with you every time you leave the house, several websites have been available for weather- and precipitation forecasts, the most famous in the Netherlands being Buienradar (www.buienradar.nl). This website is very in-depth as it shows you the 3-day weather forecast, as well as satellite projections of rain clouds of the next few hours. The problem with Buienradar is that it requires some understanding and analysis of the satellite images before one can decide. This takes time and is more complicated than it needs to be just to answer a simple question: “Will it rain?”

To simplify answering this question, I have created a simple website/tool that uses your geo-location and answers this question for you. It will tell how much time is left, as well as the exact time of when it will be raining. It will also tell you the severity of the incoming rain. Simply opening the website will give you the answer, from which you can decide if you want to bring an umbrella, or not leave the house at all!
